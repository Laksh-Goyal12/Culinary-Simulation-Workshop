## 🛠 Features

### 🧊 Ingredient Vault (Left Panel)
- **Local Compounds**: Explore a curated list of molecular ingredients, produce, and spirits.
- **Global Network Search**: If a compound isn't found locally, the system automatically queries a live recipe database to fetch molecular data.
- **Filtering**: Sort by Spices, Molecules, Spirits, or Produce.

### ⚗️ Mixing Vessel (Center Panel)
- **Compound Assembly**: Add ingredients to the vessel to see real-time updates on **Temperature** and **Viscosity**.
- **Initiate Simulation**: Trigger a 10-second molecular processing event to analyze your concoction.
- **System Log**: Real-time terminal output of simulation events.

### 📊 Simulation HUD (Right Panel)
